            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:153101:3"/>that power they deſpiſed (an effect of which Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution their wilde Declaration againſt Our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation concerning the pretended Ordinance for the <hi>Militia,</hi> and thepuniſhing of the Proclaimers appears to be) yet We muſt confeſſe, in their laſt attempt (We ſpeak of the laſt We know, they may probably ſince, or at this preſent have out-done that too) they have out-done what We conceive was their preſent Intention; And whoſoever hears of Propoſitions and Orders for bringing in of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney or Plate to maintain Horſe, Horſe-men, and Arms for the preſervation of the publike Peace, or for the defence of the King, and both Houſes of Parliament (ſuch is their Declaration, or what elſe they pleaſe to call it, of the <hi>10.</hi> of Iune) will ſurely beleeve the Peace of this Kingdom to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly ſhaken, and (at leaſt) the King himſelf to be conſulted with, and privie to theſe Propoſitions; But We hope, that when Our good Subjects ſhall finde; that this goodly Pretence of <hi>The defence of the King,</hi> is but a ſpecious Bait to ſeduce weak and inconſiderate Men into the higheſt Acts of Diſobedience and Diſloyaltie againſt Vs, and of Violence and Deſtruction upon the Laws and Conſtitutions of the Kingdom, they will no longer be captivated by an implicite Reverence to the name of <hi>both Houſes of Parliament,</hi> but will care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully examine, and conſider what number of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are preſent, and what Perſons are prevalent in thoſe Conſultations, and how the Debates are probably managed, from whence ſuch horrid and monſtrous Concluſions do reſult, and will (at leaſt)
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:153101:3"/>weigh the Reputation, Wiſdom, and Affection of thoſe, who are notoriouſly known, out of the very horrour of their proceedings to have withdrawn themſelves, or by their ſkill and violence to be driven from them and their Counſells.</p>
            <p>Whileſt their Fears and Iealouſies did ariſe, or were infuſed into the People from diſcourſes of the Rebels in <hi>Ireland,</hi> of ſkippers at <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> of Forces from <hi>Denmark, France</hi> or <hi>Spain</hi> (how impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable and ridiculous ſoever that oundſe of Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation appeared to all wiſe and knowing Men) tis no wonder, if the eaſineſſe to deceive, and the willingneſſe to be deceived did prevail over many of Our weak Subjects, to beleeve that the Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, which they did not ſee, might proceed from Cauſes, which they did not underſtand: But for them to Declare to all the world, that We intend to make War againſt Our Parliament (whileſt We ſit ſtill complaining to God Almighty of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury offered to Vs, and to the very being of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments) and that We have already begun actually to leavie Forces both of Horſe and Foot (whileſt We have onely in a legall way provided a ſmaller Guard for the ſecurity of Our own Perſon, ſo neer a Rebellion at <hi>Hull,</hi> then they have had, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out lawfull authority, above theſe eight Moneths, upon imaginary and impoſſible dangers) to impoſe upon Our Peoples ſenſe, as well as their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, by telling them, We are doing that which they ſee We are not doing, and intending that they all know (as much as Intentions can be known) We are not intending, is a boldneſſe, agreeable to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:153101:4"/>no power, but the omnipotencie of thoſe Votes, whoſe abſolute Supremacie hath almoſt brought confuſion upon King and People, and againſt which, no knowledge in matter of Fact, or conſent and authority in matter of Law they will endure ſhall be oppoſed.</p>
            <p>We have upon all occaſions with all poſſible Expreſſions profeſſed Our faſt and unſhaken Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions for Peace; And We do again (in the preſence of Almighty God Our Maker and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer) aſſure the world, that We have no more thought of making a War againſt Our Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then againſt Our own Children, That We will maintain and obſerve the Acts aſſented to by Vs this Parliament without Violation, of which, that for the frequent aſſembling of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments is one; And that We have not, or ſhall not have any thought of uſing any Force; unleſſe We ſhall be driven to it for the ſecurity of Our Perſon, and for the defence of the Religion, Laws, and Liberty of the Kingdom, and the juſt Rights and Priviledges of Parliament: And therefore We hope the Malignant Party, who have ſo much deſpiſed Our Perſon, and uſurped Our Office, ſhall not by their ſpecious fraudulent Inſinuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons prevail with Our good Subjects, to give cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to their wicked Aſſertions, and ſo to contribute their Power and Aſſiſtance for the ruine and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of Vs and themſelves.</p>
            <p>For Our Guard about Our Perſon (which not ſo much their Example as their Provocation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced Vs to take) tis known it conſiſts of the prime
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:153101:4"/>Gentry (in Fortune and Reputation) of this County, and of One Regiment of Our trained Bands, who have been ſo far from offering any affronts, injuries, or diſturbance to any of Our good Subjects, that their principall end is to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent ſuch; and ſo may be ſecurity, can be no grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance to Our People. That ſome ill affected Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, or any Perſons have been imployed in other parts to raiſe Troops under colour of Our ſervice, or have made large (or any) Offers of Reward and Preferment to ſuch as will come in, is (for ought We know, and as We beleeve) an untruth deviſed by the Contrivers of this falſe Rumour; We diſavow it, and are confident there will be no need of ſuch Art or Induſtry to induce Our lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Subjects, when they ſhall ſee Vs oppreſſed, and their Liberties and Laws confounded, (and till then We ſhall not call on them) to come in to Vs, and to aſſiſt Vs.</p>
            <p>For the Delinquents, (whom We are ſaid with an high and forcible hand to protect) let them be named, and their Delinquencie, and if We give not ſatisfaction to Iuſtice, when We ſhall have received ſatisfaction concerning Sir <hi>John Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tham</hi> by his legall Triall, then let Vs be blamed: But if the Deſigne be (as it is well known to be) after We have been driven by Force from Our City of <hi>London,</hi> and kept by force from Our Town of <hi>Hull,</hi> to protect all thoſe who are De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquents againſt Vs, and to make all thoſe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquents who attend on Vs, or execute Our lawfull Commands; We have great reaſon to be
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:153101:5"/>ſatisfied in the truth and juſtice of ſuch Accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; leſt to be Our ſervant, and to be a Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent grow to be Termes ſo convertible, that in a ſhort time We be left as naked in attendance, as they would have Vs in power, and ſo compell Vs to be waited on onely by ſuch whom they ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point and allow, and in whoſe preſence We ſhould be more miſerably alone, then in deſolation it ſelf.</p>
            <p>And if the ſeditious Contrivers and Fomenters of this Scandall upon Vs, ſhall have (as they have had) the power to miſ-lead the major Part preſent of either or both Houſes, to make ſuch Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and ſend ſuch Meſſages and Meſſengers, as they have lately done, for the Apprehenſion of the great Earls and Barons of <hi>England,</hi> as if they were Rogues or Felons; And whereby perſons of Honour and Quality are made Delinquents, meerly for attending upon Vs, and upon Our Summons, whileſt other men are forbid to come neer Vs (though obliged by the Duty of their places and Oaths) upon Our lawfull Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands: It is no wonder if ſuch Meſſengers are not very well entreated, and ſuch Orders not obeyed; neither can there be a ſurer, and a cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninger way found out to render the Authority of both Houſes ſcorned and vilified, then to aſſume to themſelves (meerly upon the Authority of the name of Parliament) a Power monſtrous to all underſtandings, and to do Actions, and to make Orders Evidently and Demonſtrably contrary to all known Law and Reaſon, (As to take up Arms againſt Vs under colour of defending Vs, To

            <p>And that all Our loving Subjects may ſee how cauſeleſſe and groundleſſe this ſcandalous Rumour and Imputation of <hi>Our raiſing War upon Our Parliament</hi> is, We have with this Our Declaration cauſed to be Printed the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of thoſe Lords, and other Perſons of Our Councell, who are here with <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s, who being up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Place, could not but diſcover ſuch Our Intentions and Preparations, and cannot be ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected for their Honours and Intereſts to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine in ſuch miſchievous and horrid Reſolutions: And therefore We ſtraightly charge and command all Our loving Subjects upon their Allegiance, and as they will anſwer the contrary at their Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rils, That they yeeld no obedience or conſent to the ſaid Propoſitions and Orders, and that they preſume not (under any ſuch Pretences, or by colour of any ſuch Orders) to raiſe or leavie any Horſe or Men, or to bring in any Money or Plate to ſuch purpoſe: But if, notwithſtanding this Cleer Declaration and Evidence of Our Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, theſe Men (whoſe Deſigne it is to compell <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s to raiſe War upon Our Parliament (which all their ſkill and malice ſhall never be able to effect) ſhall think fit by theſe Alarms to awaken Vs to a more neceſſary care of the defence of Our Self and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:153101:6"/>Our people, and ſhall themſelves (under co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of Defence) in ſo unheard of a manner pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide (and ſeduce others to do ſo too) to offend Vs, having given Vs ſo lively Teſtimony of their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections what they are willing to do, when they have once made themſelves able; All Our good Subjects will think it neceſſary to look to Our Self: And We do then excite all Our well affected people, according to their Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacie, and according to their ſolemn Vow and Proteſtation (whereby they are obliged to defend Our Perſon, Honour and Eſtate) to contribute their beſt Aſſiſtance to the Preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons neceſſary for the oppoſing and ſuppreſſing of the Traiterous Attempts of ſuch wicked and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant Perſons, who would deſtroy our Perſon, Honour and Eſtate, and engage the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in a Civill War, to ſatisfie their own lawleſſe Furie and Ambition, and ſo rob Our good Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of the bleſſed fruit of this preſent Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which they already in ſome degree have, and might ſtill reap, (to the abundant ſatisfaction and joy of the whole Kingdom) if ſuch wicked hands were not ready to ruine all their poſſeſſion, and fruſtrate all their hopes.</p>
            <p>We do therefore declare, That whoſoever, of what degree or quality ſoever, ſhall then upon ſo urgent and viſible neceſſity of Ours, and ſuch an apparent diſtraction of the Kingdom, (cauſed and begotten by the malice &amp; contrivance of this Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant partie) bring in to Vs, and Our uſe, ready Money or Plate, or ſhall underwrite to furniſh any
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:153101:7"/>number of Horſe, Horſe-men and Armes for the Preſervation of the publike peace, the defence of Our Perſon, and the vindication of the Priviledge and Freedom of Parliament, We ſhall receive it as a moſt acceptable ſervice, and as a teſtimonie of his ſingular affection to the Proteſtant Religion, the Lawes, Liberties and Peace of the Kingdom, and ſhall no longer deſire the continuance of that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, then We ſhall be ready to juſtifie and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain thoſe with the hazard of Our life.</p>
            <p>And We do further Declare, that whoſoever ſhall then bring in any ſums of Money or plate to aſſiſt Vs in this great extremity, ſhall receive con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration after the Rate of <hi>8 l. per Cent.</hi> for all ſuch Monies as he ſhall furniſh Vs withall, and ſhall upon the payment of ſuch money to ſuch Perſons, whom We ſhall appoint to receive the ſame, receive ſecurity for the ſame by good lawfull Aſſurance of ſuch of our Lands, Foreſts, Parks, and Houſes, as ſhall be ſufficient for the ſame, and more reall ſecurity then the name of <hi>Publike Faith</hi> given with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Vs and againſt Vs, as if We were no part of the Publike; And beſides We ſhall alwayes look upon it as a ſervice moſt affectionately and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably performed for the preſervation of Vs and the Kingdom: But We ſhall be much gladder that their ſubmiſſion to thoſe Our Commands, and their deſiſting from any ſuch Attempt of raiſing Horſe or Men, may eaſe all Our good Subjects of that Trouble, Charge and Vexation.</p>
